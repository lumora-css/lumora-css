title: Spacing
---

Bootstrap includes a wide range of shorthand responsive margin and padding utility classes to modify an element's appearance.

### Notation

Spacing utilities that apply to all breakpoints, from `xs` to `xxl`, have no breakpoint abbreviation in them. This is because those classes are applied from `min-width: 0` and up, and thus are not bound by a media query. The remaining breakpoints, however, do include a breakpoint abbreviation.

The classes are named using the format `{property}{sides}-{size}` for `xs` and `{property}{sides}-{breakpoint}-{size}` for `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`.

Where *property* is one of:

* `m` - for classes that set `margin`
* `p` - for classes that set `padding`

Where *sides* is one of:

* `t` - for classes that set `margin-top` or `padding-top`
* `b` - for classes that set `margin-bottom` or `padding-bottom`
* `s` - (start) for classes that set `margin-left` or `padding-left`
* `e` - (end) for classes that set `margin-right` or `padding-right`
* `x` - for classes that set both `*-left` and `*-right`
* `y` - for classes that set both `*-top` and `*-bottom`
* blank - for classes that set a `margin` or `padding` on all 4 sides of the element

Where *size* is one of:

* `0` - for classes that eliminate the `margin` or `padding` by setting it to `0`
* `1` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * .25`
* `2` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * .5`
* `3` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer`
* `4` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * 1.5`
* `5` - (by default) for classes that set the `margin` or `padding` to `$spacer * 3`
* `auto` - for classes that set the `margin` to auto
